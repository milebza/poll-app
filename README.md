# Poll app

A simple poll app for the recruitment process at Bliss Applications.

File structure and configurations automatically created using vue-cli.  

To retrieve and send data it uses the Bliss Applications' mock api so some features will seem to not work despite being fully implemented.

## Getting started

Before you start you'll need the latest version of Node.js and its package manager (npm). You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

``` bash
# to get started clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/milebza/poll-app.git
cd poll-app

# then install the dependencies
npm install

# and run the app locally
npm start
```
